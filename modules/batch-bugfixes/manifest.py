"""BATCH_BUGFIXES -- three stock 1.40C fixes as one module: MIDI Plays-Free trig, empty-pattern LED, Part-change carryover.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `8773713`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/batch-bugfixes/manifest.py`: three ROM caves (`patch_trigscale.s`, `patch_pattern_led.s`, `patch_partreapply.s`), each re-linked and
compared with the author's own bytes (`reference`) every build. Its source
paths are derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the
source on disk, as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only
re-exports its MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.

On hardware: the author's MKI (bugs 1 and 3, and bug 2's [BANK]-held stall ended); bug 2's [PTN] answers emulator-verified identical to its earlier hardware-confirmed version.
