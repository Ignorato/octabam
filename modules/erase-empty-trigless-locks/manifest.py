"""ERASE_EMPTY_TRIGLESS_LOCKS -- a trigless lock whose last lock is erased disappears instead of staying lit; FUNC + TRIG trigless locks are left alone.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `77f132f`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/erase-empty-trigless-locks/manifest.py`: one ROM cave (`patch_triglock.s`), each re-linked and
compared with the author's own bytes (`reference`) every build. Its source
paths are derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the
source on disk, as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only
re-exports its MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.

On hardware: the author's MKI (standalone image).
